# Final Project
This is my final project for MEJO 570.
Please, run the web scraper in `/python` first. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Dafondo/mejo570/tree/master/wang-final/python/).

The `final-story.rmd` notebook expects the following:
- A CSV file containing candidate info at `/python/senate2018/urls.csv`
    - Has fields for `district`, `firstname`, `aliases`, `lastname`
- Data for each candidate stored in `/python/data/senate2018/DISTRICT/LASTNAME/` with file names `q1.csv`, `q2.csv`, `q3.csv`, and `q4.csv`
